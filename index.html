        <center><h2> Tmartn and The syindicate project Own CS:GO lotto!?</h2></center>
        <center><p1>YouTube stars Trevor "Tmartn" Martin and Tom "Syndicate" Cassell were discovered as the owners of gambling site CS:GO Lotto.</p1></center>
        <center><p1>Both had promoted the game without properly disclosing their ownership, and presented the site as an easy way to earn money. Tmartn even pretended it was a site he'd simply stumbled upon.</p1>
        <center><p1>The fact these YouTubers were making money from their followers, many of whom are young people, by dressing the site up as a get rich quick scheme was distasteful. The fact they did not adequately disclose their business, on the other hand, was potentially criminal.</p1></center>
        <center><p1>And then there were the suggestions that what they'd shown viewers was not even realistic of anyone else's odds at winning. As others showed Eurogamer, with access to a gambling site's code you can very easily stack the odds, and gambling site owners were more than willing to rig bets for YouTube stars.</p1></center>
        <center><p1>Both YouTubers paused the production of new videos while the storm of negative press played out. Many of their fans were angered. CS:GO Lotto stopped taking bids. Tmartn lawyered up.</p1></center>
        </center>
        <center><p1>Media watchers noted the controversy, shook their heads at those pesky YouTubers, then moved on.</p1></center>
